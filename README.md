# Laravel Developer Challenge
a challenge for Laravel developer position in Zarcony.


### Create a Pizza order application

Implement the following logic using the Laravel framwork.

Your pizza ordering application should be with the following functionality:
 <br/> <br/>
- Add Pizza: <br/>
-- All crud functionality shoud be implemented. <br/>

- Order pizza: <br/>
-- All crud functionality shoud be implemented. <br/>
-- It should be possible to specify the desired flavors of pizza, the number of pizzas and their size. <br/>
-- An order should contain information regarding the customer (Customer name and Address are must). <br/>

- Update an order: <br/>
-- You can only update the status of delivery for the order <br/>
-- You can not delete an order unless it's delieverd. <br/>


- Retrieve an order: <br/>
-- It should be possible to retrieve the order by id or name. <br/>

- List orders: <br/>
-- List all the orders at once. <br/>
-- Filter orders by customer name or the status of delivery. <br/>


You must implement a way to check the status of delivery. <br/>
It's possible to order the same flavor of pizza but with different sizes multiple times. <br/>

#### Tasks
1. Implement and design the model / database structure.
2. Implement the functionality and API endpoints.
3. Implement tests at least one for controller and one for the API endpoints.
4. Implement the task to be running on docker (we expect to see 1 docker-compose in your project).
5. Add a brief README with instructions on how to get your code from Git clone to up and running on macOS and/or Linux hosts


#### Please note!
• Use PHP 7.2+ and the latest releases of Laravel. <br/>
• You have to implement laravel authentication. <br/>
• You don't have to implement any frontend UI. <br/>
• Keep your endpoints as RESTful as possible. <br/>
• You have to write meaningful git commits (This is very important in working with us remotely) <br/>
